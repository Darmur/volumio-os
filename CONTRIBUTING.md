# Contributing to Volumio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Volumio. It's people like you that make Volumio such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Getting Started

To get started with contributing to Volumio, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your development environment and ensure you have installed all the required packages listed in the README.md file.
2. Fork this repository

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Volumio's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Volumio
- Enable a sustainable system for Volumio's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in this template
2. Before you submit your pull request, test your changes carefully with a full build to ensure everything works as expected.
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing (if any)

### Git Flow

We use Git Flow as our branching model. The `master` branch is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state. The `dev` branch is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

When starting work on a new feature or bug, start by creating a new branch off of `dev`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

When finished with your changes, open a pull request targeting the `dev` branch.

### Small Pull Requests

In order to streamline the review process and make it easier for us to integrate your changes, we prefer small pull requests. This means that each pull request should contain changes related to a single feature or bug fix. If you have made multiple changes, please split them into separate pull requests.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
