# Systemd service to manage fs.protected_regular and fs.protected_fifos settings
# This service ensures that the kernel security settings are enforced or disabled as needed
# to maintain compatibility with applications that require access to world-writable directories.
#
# ExecStart disables the settings, allowing legacy applications that need shared access.
# ExecStop enables the settings, improving security by preventing privilege escalation attacks.
